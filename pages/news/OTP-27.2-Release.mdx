Erlang/OTP 27.2 is the second maintenance patch package for OTP 27, with mostly bug fixes as well as improvements.

## Potential incompatibilities:

* The HTTP client now correctly takes into account the `full_result` request option
  when returning an asynchronous request.


For details about bugfixes and potential incompatibilities see
the [Erlang 27.2 README](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-27.2.README)

The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,
